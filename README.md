![Showcase](./img/video.gif)

## Description
The program was created to analyze algorithms for finding public transport connections, it allows to search for a route between any two stops from a pool of available stops. As a result of its operation, a search report will be returned, containing the route found, the number of stops visited, the number of transfers, the number of sections required to walk, the length of these sections and the length of the entire route, the time of the route found and the time of the search
## Technologies
This project was developed using Flutter. Algorithms analyzed include: Dijkstra, A* (A star), BFS, DFS.
